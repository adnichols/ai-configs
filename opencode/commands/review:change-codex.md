# Change Review (Single Plan File)

Review the provided change plan as a cohesive unit. Your goal is to ensure the plan is solid and executable without scope creep or error.

Documents to review: $ARGUMENTS

## Process

### 0) Resolve Inputs (Plan File, Slug, or Legacy Bundle)

Preferred input:

- A single plan file: `thoughts/plans/<slug>.md`

Accept legacy inputs for migration only:

- `<spec_path> <tasks_path>`
- A directory containing `spec.md` and `tasks.md`

Resolution rules:

- If `$ARGUMENTS` starts with `@`, strip the leading `@` and treat as workspace-relative.
- If a single argument is an existing `.md` file, treat it as `plan_path`.
- If a single argument is a slug, resolve to `thoughts/plans/<slug>.md`.
- If the plan file does not exist but a legacy bundle exists for the slug, migrate to `thoughts/plans/<slug>.md` (do not modify legacy files) and review the migrated plan.

If multiple candidates match or a required file is missing, ask for an explicit plan file path.

### 1) Explore Codebase for Context (When Needed)

Before leaving extensive feedback, explore the codebase to confirm:

- Existing patterns and conventions
- Feasibility and integration constraints
- Correct file paths, APIs, and data structures referenced by the plan

Use the Task tool with `subagent_type=Explore` to efficiently gather context.

### 2) Review Specification (Critical Spec Review)

Read the plan. Apply a critical mindset. Don't validate; look for problems.

Look for:

- Gaps: missing requirements or edge cases.
- Risks: security, performance, or integration issues.
- Ambiguity: unclear success criteria or technical decisions.
- Technical debt: unrealistic assumptions or poor architectural choices.

Add comments:

```markdown
[REVIEW:Name] GAP: The plan mentions "user roles" but doesn't define permissions or hierarchy. [/REVIEW]
```

### 3) Review Execution Readiness (Phases + Verify + Progress)

Verify the plan is runnable and resumable:

- Phases are present (`## Phase N: ...`) and ordered.
- Each phase has:
  - `### End State` (observable outcomes)
  - `### Work` (high-level guidance)
  - `### Verify` (explicit commands and/or manual checks)
- `## Progress` exists, is coarse (phase-level), and uses stable IDs.
- `## Progress` items correspond to phase headers.
- Only `## Progress` contains checkboxes.
- `Resume Instructions (Agent)` avoids stop points and enables continuous execution.

### 4) Cross-Verification

Ensure internal consistency:

- Acceptance criteria have corresponding verification steps.
- Proposed approach matches the phase work.
- Non-goals are not accidentally reintroduced.

## Comment Guidelines

Types of issues to flag:

- INCORRECT
- SCOPE DRIFT
- GAP
- RISK
- AMBIGUITY
- WRONG REFERENCE

Usage:

- Insert tags directly into the plan document.
- Use `[REVIEW:Name] Content [/REVIEW]` format.
- Be specific and actionable.

## Summary

After adding comments to the plan, provide a single summary:

- Plan status: solid or needs rework?
- Critical issues: list the most important blockers.
- Recommendation: "Proceed with caution" or "Major revision needed".
