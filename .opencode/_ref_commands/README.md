# Reference Commands

These commands are provided for reference only and are not intended to be used directly from this directory.
The authoritative commands are installed and loaded from `~/.config/opencode/command/`.

These files are here so you can reference them in prompts if needed (e.g. "follow the pattern in .opencode/_ref_commands/cmd:graduate.md").
